# Comparative-Analysis-of-six-Clustering-algorithms
Partitioning methods K-means, K-medoid ( implemented from scratch), AGNES( implemented from scratch), hierarchical methods Birch, CHAMELEON( implemented from scratch),density-based methods DBSCAN( implemented from scratch) were implemented and applied on four different datasets.   The results were compared using ARI, NMI, and Silhouette Coefficient. Four datasets were used for comparing.
